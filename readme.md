# A very basic implementation of Rock Paper Scissors

## Full version complete - 03/03/2022

1. Buttons work
2. Design is responsive (sort of)
3. A different outrageous slogan is presented on each page load
4. Dystopian background installed
5. Move buttons replaced with play again button once round is over

I am calling this one complete. It's as close to how I imagined it as I can get right now short of learning how to make wireframe animations like the old hitchikers guide to the galaxy TV series. The stuff I didn't implement is all stuff that I didn't need. I am happy with the sleek (sleek for nightmare future dystopia, anyway) look and feel of it. I don't think it needs anything else to make it complete.
