# A very basic implementation of Rock Paper Scissors

## Alpha version complete - 09/02/2022

1. Buttons work
2. Title displays correctly
3. Design is responsive (sort of)
4. One hilarious slogan is presented on page load

I am still working on it as we speak, so this is very much not a finished version. I just wanted to have a definitely completed start point. It's going to be much more involved as it goes on. Probably more involved than paper rock scissors needs to be. But it's my project and I'm having fun.

Complete version will include:

1. Graphics for each move
2. Animated things
3. Scores
4. A reset button
5. A different slogan for each round
6. Mobile friendly
