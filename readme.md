# A very basic implementation of Rock Paper Scissors

## Full version complete - 07/03/2022

1. Buttons work
2. Design is responsive
3. A different outrageous slogan is presented on each page load
4. Dystopian background installed
5. Move buttons replaced with play again button once round is over

I am calling this one complete for the most part. I am happy with the sleek (sleek for nightmare future dystopia, anyway) look and feel of it. I will add winning and losing images at some point. I am currently learning the best way to make them work.
